            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A WARNING From J. B. T. TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>ET the Reader be warned, not to search further in these very deep Writings, or to ascend higher with his will, and to imagine deeper <hi>then hee apprehendeth:</hi> let him alwayes rest satisfyed in the Capacity, reach [and Comprehension of his understanding] for in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, he standeth yet in the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, where he erreth not, how deep so ever the Spirit leads him: For, <hi>farre more</hi> will be given to one then to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; onely this is the bound, marke, or limit, that every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue stedfast in <hi>humility</hi> towards God; and wholly resigne up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to God, that God may worke in him the will, and the deed, as he pleaseth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When thou doest this, then thou art as dead in thy selfe; for thou desirest nothing but Gods will, and the will of God is thy life; which goeth in it selfe inwardly, even unto the<note n="*" place="margin">The Crowne of Virgin So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note>
                     <hi>Thousandth Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and searcheth the Depths of the Deity with all wonders: He leadeth thy will, resigned to him, into the Virgin of his Wisedome, that thou mayst contemplate, and see all wonders; but thou mayst not set thy Imagination, off from <hi>him,</hi> into the wonders; so soone as thou doest so, thou departest from Gods will, which is the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Liberty, and art Captivated in thy owne Imagination: Marke this; for every Imagination maketh an Essence, and therein thou standest; and thou must get out thence againe, or thou <hi>seest not</hi> God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore Christ teacheth us Humilty, Love, Mercy, purity of heart, and commandeth us to seeke in Gods will, and to resigne up our selves thereunto; for in Gods will wee may doe <hi>all</hi> things: Our owne nature must not doe it, but God himselfe is zealous <hi>in Æ² S;</hi> and he is our <hi>deed,</hi> or Actor, if we worke any wonder: For
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41110:9"/> no humane Soul shall say, or thinke, I will doe wonders; no that cannot be, for the wonders surpassing the outward Nature, proceed all only from the Centre of the Eternall Nature out of the<note n="*" place="margin">The Eternall fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Tenth Number;</hi> Which the Creature <hi>cannot</hi> [reach into:] But if it be resigned unto the will of God, then God doth wonders in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; For it is his pleasure to manifest himselfe in the weake [in the low, meeke and humble mind,] for the <hi>strong</hi> is stiffe in his owne will, and will not resigne and surrender it to God; He trusteth to himselfe in his owne wit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thus his will is without God, and can doe nothing; and if he then speaketh of the Being, and will of God, he is a Lyer, for he speaketh not from the spirit, and will of God; but from his owne selfe, from his owne weening, and <hi>Conjecture;</hi> In which is meer doubt [and uncertainty, albeit he may alleadge, quote, and draw never so many sayings of other men according to his apprehension to confirme his opinion and way,] And hence arise, the many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, Controversies, and contentions, about Faith, and divine knowledge, that men goe about to seeke God in their owne will, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>kill; men would find God in their owne will, and he is <hi>not</hi> therein; for he dwelleth onely in that will, which resigneth it selfe up with all its reason, and skill to <hi>HIM;</hi> to such an one he giveth reall living knowledge, and power; to know and understand his <hi>Being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Therefore we shall be dumb, dark, and hystoricall to every one that is not borne of God; For we are according to the outward man in this World and according to the inward in God: the inward man borne of God speaketh of the Kingdome of Heaven, and the outward spirit produced from the <hi>Principle</hi> of this World, speaketh of this World; Thereupon one mans understanding is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then another; all, according as every one is <hi>Gifted with Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> so he apprehendeth, and so he interpreteth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Every one will not understand my Writings according to my minde, [meaning, and understanding,] yea <hi>perhaps</hi> not one: but <hi>every one</hi> receiveth according to his Gifts, for his edification, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; according as the spirit hath its propertie, [forme, and Idea] in him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He that will not seeke <hi>thereby,</hi> [to be] a new man, borne in God, [or the regeneration in the spirit of Christ] and wholly, and unfeignedly apply himselfe thereto, let him let my Writings alone, and leave them uncensured; I have written nothing for such a Seeker; also he will <hi>not be able wholly</hi> to understand our meaning though hee excerciseth [and striveth] much about it, unlesse he entreth into the <hi>Resignation</hi> in <hi>Christ;</hi> and there he may obtain, and apprehend the spirit of the <hi>Æ²niversall,</hi> else all will be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and we will warne the curious, <hi>Critick,</hi> speculator, and rationall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41110:9"/> Artist; that he <hi>amuse not</hi> himselfe; he effecteth nothing in this way, except he himselfe entreth thereinto, and then it will be manifest unto him <hi>without much</hi> seeking, for the way is plain and <hi>Childlike,</hi> and it is truely, and faithfully Declared, and described <hi>in my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Let no man blind-fold himselfe in respect of the simplicity of this hand: for we must be Children if we will finde <hi>the Lilly</hi> of the holy Plant, and <hi>enter into the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> our desire must onely be directed in all plainenesse, and down-right syncerity, unto our first Mother again; from whom we are departed in <hi>Adam,</hi> and become <hi>Selfists;</hi> we must goe out from, and disclaim our reason, and step into the obedience of our first <hi>Eternall</hi> Mother, and then we receive the spirit and life of the Mother, and then also we <hi>know</hi> her habitation, and her food.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Indeed it lyeth not in the power of outward reason; but to the spirit of God there is nothing impossible: and if we be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and regenerate again of God in Christ; the Sonne may well see what the Father doth in his House, and also learne his Art, and worke: If we then be the Mystery of God, we ought not to think, as if we might not dare to meddle with Mysteries, as <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ teacheth;</hi> For none can take unto himselfe any thing of Gods Mysteries, unlesse it be given him; and Saint <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>Every good, and perfect gift commeth downe from above, from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, or alteration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. We have in our Writings, set you downe according to the true ground, what man was before his fall, what he is now in the fall, and what he is again in the New-birth; and also what he shall be after this life: for we know what he is in death, and what in life; also we know, what he is in Hell: also we have set you downe the whole ground of the Divine Being; and also of the Creation of all things: of that which is Eternall, and of that which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible: and how every thing is made, and come to be as it is, and also what it shall be afterwards; and therein lyeth <hi>the Key of the Grand Mystery,</hi> so far as a <hi>Creature</hi> is <hi>able</hi> to <hi>comprehend</hi> and <hi>beare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. And this we have done, not from our owne wit and reason, as if it were greater then any mans living; but in the Mothers bosome, in the mothers spirit: I am dead and as a nothing; when I speake and write so, I write not from my <hi>Selfe;</hi> but from the knowledge and seeing of the Mother: and yet I live in care, trouble, and labour, in feare, and trembling, and in temptation, like other men; for I have <hi>Adams</hi> skin and live in the hope of <hi>Israel:</hi> This I write that the Reader might know, wherein my knowledge and skill standeth; that so he seek not that by me, which I am not; for I am <hi>no more</hi> then all other men, who in <hi>Christ Jesus our King</hi> wrestle for the <hi>Crowne</hi> of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41110:10"/> Eternall joy, and live in the <hi>hope</hi> of perfection, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The Reader may perhaps wonder how a plain <hi>Lay-man</hi> could come to understand such high things, having never read them, nor heard them from any man; but I tell you, that which you see set down in my Writings is <hi>but a glimps</hi> of the Mysteries; a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not write them: if God shall count <hi>you</hi> worthy to have the light enkindled in your soul, you would see, tast, smel, feele, and heare, unspeakable words of God, concerning this knowledge; and therein is the true <hi>Theosophicall School of Pentecost,</hi> where the Soul is taught of God; <hi>Christ</hi> saith <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Seek and you shall finde, knock and it shall be opened unto you:</hi> Also, <hi>my Father will give the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="13">13. I have no other cause, and incitement to write, but only from a desire of upright love, towards Gods Children; that I might once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create and refresh my selfe with them; I doe it not for any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall wealth, honour, or gifts, <hi>But for the hope of Israel,</hi> that in the other life I might eternally rejoyce and triumph with my Brethren, and then my labour which here I performe in love towards them, shall be <hi>well</hi> recompensed; therfore I am in good earnest, seeing Christ faithfully warneth us, <hi>Not to hide our Talent under the napkin, or bury it in the earth. Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. Therefore, <hi>We ought not greatly to be affraid of man, who can onely kill the body, and then can doe no more: but feare him that is able to destroy both body and soul, and cast them into Hell, Mat.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. I declare in the presence of God, as I shall answer it before his Judgement where all things shall <hi>appeare,</hi> and every one shall give an account of his deeds; that I my selfe know not how it comes to passe, with me, save onely that I have a fiery incitement, or strong driving and instigation in my will: I know not also what I shall write, for when I write, the spirit dictates to me, in great and wonderfull knowledge; insomuch that I often know not <hi>whether</hi> according to my spirit, <hi>I be in this World or no,</hi> and at this I doe exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, where then sure and certain knowledge is imparted to me, and the more I seeke the more I finde; and continually deeper, that I oft times account my sinfull Person too mean, low, and unworthy, to set upon such Mysteries; but then the spirit setteth up my <hi>Banner,</hi> and saith, <hi>Arise thou shalt eternally live therein, and be Crowned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, why art thou amazed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. Seeing therefore I have an effectuall knowledge in the light and power; it is a meere Gift of God, who likewise in such sort,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41110:10"/> giveth me a driving will thereto, so that I must write what I see and know; thereupon I must obey God rather then man, least my<note n="*" place="margin">Bishoprick, or Ministry.</note>
                     <hi>Office</hi> be taken away from me and given unto another, which verily would <hi>for ever greive me:</hi> and albeit while I live I shall obtain smal thankes from some, who love their Belly, more then God and the Kingdome of Heaven, yet my writings have their Gifts, and are for their time; for they have a very rare pretious and earnest<note n="â " place="margin">Originall.</note>
                     <hi>Birth,</hi> and rise, there is many a noble Rose bud conteined in them, which by reason of the great darkenesse in <hi>Babel</hi> cannot be knowne, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, but <hi>there is a Time,</hi> whereto it belongeth; according to its spirit.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. I am verily a simple man, and have neither Learned, nor after this manner, sought after this high Mystery, nor knew I any thing of it, I onely sought the heart of love in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> and when I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that with great Joy of my soul, then was <hi>this Treasure</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and divine knowledge, opened and given unto me; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I have not hitherto proudly prancked and vaunted, but desired from my heart and earnestly sought of God, whether the time was come that this knowledge might be revealed, in the hearts of many: concerning which I also obtained a very powerfull and <hi>Effectuall Answer,</hi> so that I well know, what I have hinted and signified in my writings.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And although I am therefore despised and hated of many in the World, yet men shall see very shortly, wherfore God hath opened unto a simple plaine Lay-man <hi>The Grand Mystery,</hi> that is, the ground of all secrets and Mysteries; and I <hi>may not reveale all,</hi> that is made knowne unto me; and yet it might verily be revealed <hi>unto</hi> worthy men; if I found that it were the will of God and profitable to man: Doe not so greatly wonder at the simplicity wherewith God doth it; for the time of the proud and haughty is drawing to a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. I warne and exhort the Reader in the love of Christ to <hi>try</hi> and <hi>examine</hi> my writings with a right Christian minde, and then his eyes will be opened that he shall see, and understand, and it is my Prayer to God, for the true earnest seeker, that he may be <hi>Crowned</hi> with the fair Garland of Divine honour, in the knowledge of the wisedome, that so he may have <hi>no need</hi> to use eyther mine or others Writings for the knowledge of God; but know the Lord in himselfe, as the like is hapned [or granted] to mee: from which I write, and make use of nothing else; for it is written, <hi>They shall all be taught of God, and know the Lord, I will powre out my Spirit upon all flesh:</hi> Also <hi>Your Daughters and your Sonnes shall prophecy and your young men shall see Visions;</hi> wherefore then will men despise and contemne this, when <hi>God</hi> powreth forth his spirit upon so simple a man, that he must write,
